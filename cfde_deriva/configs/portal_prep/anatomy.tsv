UBERON:0001857	anterior semicircular duct		[]
UBERON:0001858	posterior semicircular duct	The semicircular canals are three half-circular, interconnected tubes located inside each ear. The three canals are the horizontal semicircular canal (also known as the lateral semicircular canal), superior semicircular canal (also known as the anterior semicircular canal), and the posterior semicircular canal. The canals are aligned approximately orthogonally to one another. The horizontal canal is aligned roughly horizontally in the head. The superior and anterior canals are aligned roughly at a 45 degree angle to a vertical plane drawn from the nose to the back of the skull. Thus, the horizontal canal detects horizontal head movements (such as when doing a pirouette), while the superior and posterior canals detect vertical head movements. Each canal is filled with a fluid called endolymph and contains a motion sensor with little hairs whose ends are embedded in a gelatinous structure called the cupula. As the skull twists in any direction, the endolymph is thrown into different sections of the canals. The cilia detect when the endolymph rushes past, and a signal is then sent to the brain. The semicircular canals are a component of the Labyrinth. Among species of mammals, the size of the semicircular canals is correlated with their type of locomotion. Specifically, species that are agile and have fast, jerky locomotion have larger canals relative to their body size than those that move more cautiously.	[]

UBERON:0001907	zona incerta	The zona incerta is a horizontally elongated region of gray matter cells in the subthalamus below the thalamus. Its connections project extensively over the brain from the cerebral cortex down into the spinal cord.

UBERON:0001910	medial forebrain bundle	The Medial forebrain bundle (MFB), is a complex bundle of axons coming from the basal olfactory regions, the periamygdaloid region, and the septal nuclei, and passing to the lateral hypothalamus, with some carrying on into the tegmentum. It contains both ascending and descending fibers. It also represents a part of the mesolimbic pathway, carrying information between the ventral tegmentum and the nucleus accumbens. It is commonly accepted that the MFB is a part of the reward system, involved in the integration of reward and pleasure. Electrical stimulation of the medial forebrain bundle is believed to cause sensations of pleasure. This hypothesis is based upon intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) studies. Animals will work for MFB ICSS, and humans report that MFB ICSS is intensely pleasurable. This is most likely because the medial forebrain bundle carries information from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) to the nucleus accumbens (nAcc or Acb). The nAcc is a recognized reward center, and activation of the pathway from the VTA to the nAcc is believed to be rewarding, which is why it is sometimes referred to as the hedonic highway..

UBERON:0002147	reticulotegmental nucleus	The tegmental pontine reticular nucleus (or pontine reticular nucleus of the tegmentum) is an area within the floor of the midbrain. This area is known to affect the cerebellum with its axonal projections. These efferent connections have been proven to project not only ipsilaterally, but also to decussate and project to the contralateral side of the vermis. It has also been shown that the projections from the tegmenti pontis to the cerebellar lobes are only crossed fibers. The n.r. tegmenti pontis also receives afferent axons from the cerebellum. This nucleus is known for its large amount of multipolar cells and its particularly reticular structure. The n.r. tegmenti pontis is topographically related to pontine nuclei (non-reticular), being just dorsal to them. The nucleus reticularis has been known to mediate eye movements, otherwise known as so-called saccadic movement. This makes sense concerning their connections as it would require a nucleus which receives and projects to the cerebellum to mediate that kind of complex circuitry. Also, behaviorally this makes sense as no one thinks about saccadic movements when scanning a room and the saccadic movements are not directly controlled by the cortex. The nuclei of the cerebellum are the most traditionally studied mostly because it is easy to see which nuclei degrade when the cerebellum is amputated. The neurons of the lateral reticular formation are very important for reflexes and the mediation of posture. It has been shown in cats that electrical stimulation of the reticular formation can make a standing cat lie down. Conversely if the cat is stimulated in an alternate spot it can make a lying cat stand.

UBERON:0002155	gigantocellular nucleus	Nucleus located in the rostral ventrolateral medulla. The PGL was originally identified by cytoarchitectural criteria in the human medulla (Olszewski and Baxter, 1954). In humans, the PGL is located in the ventrolateral quadrant of the rostral medullary tegmentum between the nucleus subtrigeminalis caudally, trapezoid body and the superior olive rostrally, nucleus gigantocellularis medially, spinothalamic tract fibers laterally, inferior olive ventrally, and the nucleus ambiguous dorsally (Olszewski and Baxter, 1954). In the rat, the PGL has been further subdivided into retrofacial PGL (caudal to the facial nucleus), and more rostrally located juxtafacial PGL (medial to the facial nucleus), based upon different connectivity.

UBERON:0002156	nucleus raphe magnus	The nucleus raphe magnus, located directly rostral to the raphe obscurus, is afferently stimulated from axons in the spinal cord and cerebellum. This makes the magnus a likely candidate for part of the motor system; however, it seems to participate in the endogenous analgesia system. The magnus receives descending afferents from the periaqueductal gray, the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus, central nucleus of the amygdala, lateral hypothalamic area, parvocellular reticular nucleus and the prelimbic, infralimbic, medial and lateral precentral cortices . All of these brain areas influence the main function of the raphe magnus. The main function of the magnus is mostly pain mediation; in fact it sends projections to the dorsal horn of the spinal cord to directly inhibit pain. The periaquiductal gray, the epicenter of analgesia, sends efferent connections to the nucleus raphe magnus in when it is stimulated by opiates (endogenous or otherwise). Electrical stimulation of the PAG produces analgesia, as well as administration of morphine to the PAG or n.r. magnus. The antinociceptic effects of electrical stimulation of the PAG can be blocked by administering naloxone, an opiate antagonist, to the n.r. magnus. All of this seems to indicate that the magnus is part of the endogenous opiate system, and acts to inhibit pain in the spinal cord..

UBERON:0002157	nucleus raphe pallidus	The nucleus raphe pallidus receives afferent connections from the periaqueductal gray, the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus, central nucleus of the amygdala, lateral hypothalamic area, and parvocellular reticular nucleus. Also, the pallidus receives afferents from the medial preoptic area, median preoptic nucleus and lateral paragigantocellular reticular nuclei . The pallidus has recently been shown to be involved in the activation of a fever as an immunoreaction. It has been implied that the preoptic area is constantly inhibiting the raphe pallidus, especially the rostral portion, with GABA. When the preoptic area receives immune signals from the body, the inhibition stops and the rostral portion of the raphe pallidus excites the intermediolateral cell column, which induces a fever . The raphe pallidus has also been known to mediate the tachycardia response, an extremely high heart rate known to be incited by emotional or psychological stress. Microinjections of a GABA-a antagonist into the raphe pallidus, induces an increased heart rate. Conversely, microinjections of muscimol, a GABA-a agonist, inhibit tachycardia in rats under air-stress stimuli. In both of these cases, GABA is mediating two different sympathetic responses, so clearly the nucleus raphe pallidus is a far more a complex nucleus than previously thought..

The mediastinal lymph nodes along the esophagus are in tight connection with the abdominal lymph nodes along the esophagus and the stomach. That fact facilitates spreading of tumors cells through these lymphatics in cases of cancers of the stomach and particularly of the esophagus. Through the mediastinum, the main lymphatic drainage from the abdominal organs goes via the thoracic duct (ductus thoracicus), which drains majority of the lymph from the abdomen to the above mentioned left venous angle.

UBERON:0002535	gill	Anatomical surface structure found in many aquatic organisms. It is a respiration organ whose function is the extraction of oxygen from water and the excretion of carbon dioxide. The microscopic structure of a gill is such that it presents a very large surface area to the external environment. Gills usually consist of thin filaments of tissue, branches, or slender tufted processes which have a highly folded surface to increase surface area. A high surface area is crucial to the gas exchange of aquatic organisms as water contains only 1/20 parts dissolved Oxygen compared to air. With the exception of some aquatic insects, the filaments and lamellae (folds) contain blood or coelomic fluid, from which gases are exchanged through the thin walls. Oxygen is carried by the blood to other parts of the body. Carbon dioxide passes from the blood through the thin gill tissue into the water. Gills or gill-like organs, located in different parts of the body, are found in various groups of aquatic animals, including mollusks, crustaceans, insects, fish, and amphibians.	[]

The connections of the medial dorsal nucleus have even been used to delineate the prefrontal cortex of the Göttingen minipig brain. By stereology the number of brain cells in the region has been estimated to around 6.43 million neurons in the adult human brain and 36.3 million glial cells, and with the newborn having quite different numbers: around 11.2 million neurons and 10.6 million glial cells. Lesions of the medial dorsal nucleus have been associated with Wernicke's encephalopathy.

UBERON:0003061	blood island	Blood islands are structures in the developing embryo which lead to many different parts of the circulatory system. They primarily derive from plexuses formed from angioblasts. Within them, vacuoles appear through liquefaction of the central part of the syncytium into plasma. The lumen of the blood vessels thus formed is probably intracellular. The flattened cells at the periphery form the endothelium. The nucleated red blood corpuscles develop either from small masses of the original angioblast left attached to the inner wall of the lumen or directly from the flat endothelial cells. In either case the syncytial mass thus formed projects from and is attached to the wall of the vessel. Such a mass is known as a blood island and hemoglobin gradually accumulates within it. Later the cells on the surface round up, giving the mass a mulberry-like appearance. Then the red blood cells break loose and are carried away in the plasma. Such free blood cells continue to divide. Blood islands have been seen in the area vasculosa in the omphalomesenteric vein and arteries, and in the dorsal aorta.	["blood islands","ventral lateral plate mesoderm"]
UBERON:0003062	primitive knot	organizer for gastrulation in vertebrates.

Posterior to the node is the primitive pit, where the cells of the epiblast (the upper layer of embryonic cells) initially begin to invaginate.

UBERON:0004616	mammalian cervical vertebra 7	Vertebra prominens is the proper name for the seventh cervical vertebra. The most distinctive characteristic of this vertebra is the existence of a long and prominent spinous process which is palpable from the skin surface, hence the name. This spinous process is thick, nearly horizontal in direction, not bifurcated, but terminating in a tubercle to which the lower end of the ligamentum nuchae is attached. The seventh cervical vertebra (C7) has the most prominent spinous process only in about 70% of people; in the remainder, either C6 or T1 (the first thoracic vertebra) will be the most prominent. The transverse processes are of considerable size, their posterior roots are large and prominent, while the anterior are small and faintly marked; the upper surface of each has usually a shallow sulcus for the eighth spinal nerve, and its extremity seldom presents more than a trace of bifurcation. The foramen transversarium may be as large as that in the other cervical vertebrae, but is generally smaller on one or both sides; occasionally it is double, sometimes it is absent. On the left side it occasionally gives passage to the vertebral artery; more frequently the vertebral vein traverses it on both sides; but the usual arrangement is for both artery and vein to pass in front of the transverse process, and not through the foramen. Sometimes the anterior root of the transverse process attains a large size and exists as a separate bone, which is known as a cervical rib.

UBERON:0004688	costo-cervical trunk	The costocervical trunk arises from the upper and back part of the subclavian artery, behind the scalenus anterior on the right side, and medial to that muscle on the left side. Passing backward, it splits into the deep cervical artery and the supreme intercostal artery (or the Highest intercostal artery), which descends behind the pleura in front of the necks of the first and second ribs, and anastomoses with the first aortic intercostal (3rd posterior intercostal artery). As it crosses the neck of the first rib it lies medial to the anterior division of the first thoracic nerve, and lateral to the first thoracic ganglion of the sympathetic trunk. In the first intercostal space, it gives off a branch which is distributed in a manner similar to the distribution of the aortic intercostals. The branch for the second intercostal space usually joins with one from the highest aortic intercostal artery. This branch is not constant, but is more commonly found on the right side; when absent, its place is supplied by an intercostal branch from the aorta. Each intercostal gives off a posterior branch which goes to the posterior vertebral muscles, and sends a small spinal branch through the corresponding intervertebral foramen to the medulla spinalis and its membranes..

UBERON:0004723	interlobular artery	The branches of the arcuate arteries of the kidney that radiate outward throught the renal columns and supply the glomeruli. The first set of renal bloodvessels, the interlobular arteries (or cortical radiate arteries, or cortical radial arteries), are given off at right angles from the side of the arcuate arteries looking toward the cortical substance, and pass directly outward between the medullary rays to reach the fibrous tunic, where they end in the capillary network of this part. These vessels do not anastomose with each other, but form what are called end-arteries. In their outward course they give off lateral branches; these are the afferent vessels for the renal corpuscles; they enter the capsule, and end in the glomerulus. From each tuft the corresponding efferent vessel arises, and, having made its egress from the capsule near to the point where the afferent vessel enters, breaks up into a number of branches, which form a dense plexus within Bowman's capsule.

UBERON:0005722	obsolete nephrotome	The nephrotome is a section of the mesoderm. It gives rise to the pronephros and eventually to the rest of the kidney. A nephrotome is an obsolete term used to describe rounded mesodermal portions of the forming pronephros. In old texts the pronephros is described as forming through the fusion of multiple nephrotomes. Modern visualization methods such as scanning electron microscopy, in situ hybridization and confocal microscopy, combined with the simple approach of peeling off the epidermis to see the forming kidney, have shown that this is not the case. Nephric mesenchyme separates from the intermediate mesoderm as a single elongated primordia. As this primordia begins to undergo epithelialization the anterior portions of the pronephros form rounded protrusions, which then later become the dorsal branches of the pronephros that link to nephrostomes (distinct from nephrotomes). These rounded bumps are probably the structures observed in histological sections that are referred to as nephrotomes. Nephrostomes are thin ciliated funnels that link pronephric nephrons to the ceolom, and are not related to nephrotomes.	[]

UBERON:0005806	portal system	In the circulatory system of animals, a portal venous system occurs when a capillary bed drains into another capillary bed through veins, without first going through the heart. Both capillary beds and the blood vessels that connect them are considered part of the portal venous system. They are relatively uncommon as the majority of capillary beds drain into veins which then drain into the heart, not into another capillary bed. Portal venous systems are considered venous because the blood vessels that join the two capillary beds are either veins or venules. Examples of such systems include the hepatic portal system and the hypophyseal portal system. Unqualified, 'portal venous system' often refers to the hepatic portal system. For this reason, 'portal vein' most commonly refers to the hepatic portal vein.	["portal venous system"]
UBERON:0005807	rostral ventrolateral medulla	Control of blood pressure is crucially dependent on the integrity of a small region of the brainstem called the ventrolateral medulla.

One of these regions is the Rostral Ventrolateral Medulla (RVLM) is also known as the pressor area of the medulla (medulla pressor). It receives inhibitory GABAergic input from the caudal ventrolateral medulla (CVLM). The RVLM is the primary regulator of the sympathetic nervous system, sending excitatory fibers (catecholaminergic) to the sympathetic preganglionic neurons in the spinal cord, via reticulospinal tract.

It is part of the posterior column of the spinal cord, which also contains the fasciculus cuneatus, which carries the same information from the upper part of the body. This tract and its continuation in the brain stem is often referred to as the posterior column-medial lemniscus pathway. The fasciculus gracilis is wedge-shaped on transverse section and lies next the posterior median septum, its base being at the surface of the medulla spinalis, and its apex directed toward the posterior gray commissure. It increases in size from below upward, and consists of long thin fibers that are derived from the posterior nerve roots, and ascend as far as the medulla oblongata, where they end in the nucleus gracilis.

UBERON:0006479	Brodmann (1909) area 38	Brodmann area 38, also BA38 or temporopolar area 38 (H), is part of the temporal cortex in the human brain. BA 38 is at the anterior end of the temporal lobe, known as the temporal pole. BA38 is a subdivision of the cytoarchitecturally defined temporal region of cerebral cortex. It is located primarily in the most rostral portions of the superior temporal gyrus and the middle temporal gyrus. Cytoarchitecturally it is bounded caudally by the inferior temporal area 20, the middle temporal area 21, the superior temporal area 22 and the ectorhinal area 36 (Brodmann-1909). Cytoarchitectonic and chemoarchitectonic studies find that it contains at least seven subareas, one of which, TG, is unique to humans. 'The functional significance of this area TG is not known, but it may bind complex, highly processed perceptual inputs to visceral emotional responses.' This area is among the earliest affected by Alzheimer's disease and the earliest involved at the start of temporal lobe seizures.

Situated just anterior to premotor cortex and on the lateral surface, inferior to BA9. This area is also known as pars opercularis (of the inferior frontal gyrus), and it refers to a subdivision of the cytoarchitecturally defined frontal region of cerebral cortex. In the human it corresponds approximately to the opercular part of inferior frontal gyrus (H). Thus, it is bounded caudally by the inferior precentral sulcus (H) and rostrally by the anterior ascending limb of lateral sulcus (H). It surrounds the diagonal sulcus (H). In the depth of the lateral sulcus it borders on the insula. Cytoarchitectonically it is bounded caudally and dorsally by the agranular frontal area 6, dorsally by the granular frontal area 9 and rostrally by the triangular area 45 (Brodmann-1909).

UBERON:0006483	Brodmann (1909) area 46	Brodmann area 46, or BA46, is part of the frontal cortex in the human brain. It is between BA10 and BA45. BA46 is known as middle frontal area 46. In the human it occupies approximately the middle third of the middle frontal gyrus and the most rostral portion of the inferior frontal gyrus. Brodmann area 46 roughly corresponds with the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), although the borders of area 46 are based on cytoarchitecture rather than function. The DLPFC also encompasses part of granular frontal area 9, directly adjacent on the dorsal surface of the cortex. Cytoarchitecturally, BA46 is bounded dorsally by the granular frontal area 9, rostroventrally by the frontopolar area 10 and caudally by the triangular area 45 (Brodmann-1909). There is some discrepancy between the extent of BA8 (Brodmann-1905) and the same area as described by Walker (1940)	["area 46 of Brodmann","area 46 of Brodmann-1909","area frontalis media","B09-46","B09-46","BA46","Brodmann (1909) area 46","Brodmann area 46","Brodmann area 46, middle frontal","middle frontal area 46"]

Curving from the lateral surface of the frontal lobe into the ventral (orbital) frontal cortex. It is below areas BA10 and BA45, and beside BA11. This area is also known as orbital area 47. In the human, on the orbital surface it surrounds the caudal portion of the orbital sulcus (H) from which it extends laterally into the orbital part of inferior frontal gyrus (H). Cytoarchitectonically it is bounded caudally by the triangular area 45, medially by the prefrontal area 11 of Brodmann-1909, and rostrally by the frontopolar area 10 (Brodmann-1909). It incorporates the region that Brodmann identified as 'Area 12' in the monkey, and therefore, following the suggestion of Michael Petrides, some contemporary neuroscientists refer to the region as 'BA47/12. ' BA47 has been implicated in the processing of syntax in spoken and signed languages, and more recently in musical syntax.

UBERON:0006564	superficial palmar arch	The superficial palmar arch is formed predominantly by the ulnar artery, with a contribution from the superficial palmar branch of the radial artery. However, in some individuals the contribution from the radial artery might be absent, and instead anastomoses with either the princeps pollicis artery, the radialis indicis artery, or the median artery, the former two of which are branches from the radial artery. Alternative names for this arterial arch are: superficial volar arch, superficial ulnar arch, arcus palmaris superficialis, or arcus volaris superficialis. The arch passes across the palm in a curve with its convexity downward. If one were to fully extend the thumb, the superficial palmar arch would lie approximately at the level of a line drawn from the distal border of the thumb across the palm. The superficial palmar arch is more distal than the deep palmar arch. Three common palmar digital arteries arise from the arch, proceeding down on the second, third, and fourth lumbrical muscles, respectively. They each receive a contribution from a palmar metacarpal artery. Near the level of the metacarpophalangeal joints, each common palmar digital artery divides into two proper palmar digital arteries.

[]
UBERON:0006635	anterior abdominal wall	The abdominal wall represents the boundaries of the abdominal cavity. The abdominal wall is split into the posterior (back), lateral (sides) and anterior (front) walls. There is a common set of layers covering and forming all the walls: the deepest being the extraperitoneal fat, the parietal peritoneum, and a layer of fascia which has different names over where it covers (eg transversalis, psoas fascia). Superficial to these, but not present in the posterior wall are the three layers of muscle, the transversus abdominis (transverse abdominal muscle), the internal (obliquus internus) and the external oblique (obliquus externus).	["ventral abdominal wall"]
UBERON:0006636	lumbar artery	The lumbar arteries are in series with the intercostals. They are usually four in number on either side, and arise from the back of the aorta, opposite the bodies of the upper four lumbar vertebrC&. A fifth pair, small in size, is occasionally present: they arise from the middle sacral artery. They run lateralward and backward on the bodies of the lumbar vertebrC&, behind the sympathetic trunk, to the intervals between the adjacent transverse processes, and are then continued into the abdominal wall. The arteries of the right side pass behind the inferior vena cava, and the upper two on each side run behind the corresponding crus of the diaphragm. The arteries of both sides pass beneath the tendinous arches which give origin to the Psoas major, and are then continued behind this muscle and the lumbar plexus.

The cervical loop is a histologic term indicating a specific epithelial structure at the apical side of the tooth germ, consisting of loosely aggregated stellate reticulum in the center surrounded by stratum intermedium. These tissues are enveloped by a basal layer of epithelium known on the outside of the tooth as outer enamel epithelium and on the inside as inner enamel epithelium.

UBERON:0006974	metanephridium	A type of excretory gland or nephridium found in many types of invertebrates such as Annelids, Arthropods and Molluscs. It typically consists of a ciliated funnel opening into the body cavity or coelom connected to a duct which may be variously glandularized, folded or expanded (vesiculate) and which typically opens to the organism's exterior. These ciliated tubules pump water carrying surplus ions, metabolic waste, toxins from food, and useless hormones out of the organism through openings known as nephrostomes. This waste is passed out of the body at the nephridiopore. The primary urine produced by filtration of blood (or a similar functioning fluid) is modified into secondary urine through selective reabsorption by the cells lining the metanephridium. In many earthworms the nephridial ducts open into the digestive tract instead, a condition known as enteronephry.	[]

Irregular bones serve various purposes in the body, such as protection of nervous tissue, affording multiple anchor points for skeletal muscle attachment (as with the sacrum), and maintaining pharynx and trachea support, and tongue attachment (such as the hyoid bone). They consist of cancellous tissue enclosed within a thin layer of compact bone. The irregular bones are: the vertebrC&, sacrum, coccyx, temporal, sphenoid, ethmoid, zygomatic, maxilla, mandible, palatine, inferior nasal concha, and hyoid.	["os irregulare"]

UBERON:0008194	tibiotarsus	The tibiotarsus is the large bone between the femur and the tarsometatarsus in the leg of a bird. It is the fusion of the proximal part of the tarsus with the tibia. A similar structure also occurred in the Mesozoic Heterodontosauridae. These small ornithischian dinosaurs were unrelated to birds and the similarity of their pes bones is best explained by convergent evolution.	[]
UBERON:0008195	tarsometatarsus	The tarsometatarsus is a bone that is found in the lower leg of certain tetrapods, namely birds. It is formed from the fusion of several bones found in other types of animals, and homologous to the mammalian tarsal (ankle) and metatarsal (pes) bones. Despite this, the tarsometatarsus of birds is often referred to as just the tarsus or metatarsus.	[]

UBERON:0008200	forehead	The part of the face above the eyes. In human anatomy, the forehead is the fore part of the head. It is, formally, an area of the head bounded by three features, two of the skull and one of the scalp. The top of the forehead is marked by the hairline, the edge of the area where hair on the scalp grows. The bottom of the forehead is marked by the supraorbital ridge, the bone feature of the skull above the eyes. The two sides of the forehead are marked by the temporal ridge, a bone feature that links the supraorbital ridge to the coronal suture line and beyond.	[]
UBERON:0008201	scute	A bony external plate or scale, as on the shell of a turtle, the skin of crocodilians, the feet of some birds. Scutes are similar to scales and serve the same function. Unlike the scales of fish and snakes, which are formed from the epidermis, scutes are formed in the lower vascular layer of the skin and the epidermal element is only the top surface. Forming in the living dermis, the scutes produce a horny outer layer, that is superficially similar to that of scales. Scutes will usually not overlap as snake scales (but see the pangolin). The outer keratin layer is shed piecemeal, and not in one continuous layer of skin as seen in snakes or lizards. The dermal base may contain bone and produce dermal armour. Scutes with a bony base are properly called osteoderms. Dermal scutes are also found in the feet of birds and tails of some mammals, and are believed to be the primitive form of dermal armour in reptiles. The term is also used to describe the heavy armour of the armadillo and the extinct glyptodon, and is occasionally used as an alternative to scales in describing snakes or certain fishes, such as sturgeons.

UBERON:0008243	upper back muscle	A muscle of back that is part of a dorsal thoracic segment of trunk.	[]
UBERON:0008245	pennate muscle	A pennate muscle (also called a penniform muscle) is a muscle with fascicles that attach obliquely (in a slanting position) to its tendon. These types of muscles generally allow better stabilization and force production but less flexibility. Individual muscle fibers are formed into bundles of fasciculi and these bundles of fasciculi are formed into bundles of fascicles which compose the entire muscle itself. In a pennate muscle, the fascicles will form an angle with its central tendon. If all the fascicles are on the same side of the tendon, the pennate muscle is called unipennate. Examples of this include certain muscles in the manus. If there are fascicles on both sides of the central tendon, the pennate muscle is called bipennate. The rectus femoris, a large muscle in the quadriceps, is typical. If the central tendon branches within a pennate muscle, the muscle is called multipennate, as seen in the deltoid muscle in the shoulder.	[]
UBERON:0008246	pyloric stomach	The mouth of a starfish is located on the underside of the body, and opens through a short esophagus into firstly a cardiac stomach, and then, a second, pyloric stomach. Each arm also contains two pyloric caeca, long hollow tubes branching outwards from the pyloric stomach. Each pyloric caecum is lined by a series of digestive glands, which secrete digestive enzymes and absorb nutrients from the food. A short intestine runs from the upper surface of the pyloric stomach to open at an anus in the center of the upper body	[]
UBERON:0008247	tube foot	One of the numerous external, fluid-filled muscular tubes of echinoderms, such as the starfish or sea urchin, serving as organs of locomotion, food handling, and respiration. Tube feet consist of two parts: ampulla and podia. Ampulla contain both circular muscles and longitudinal muscle, whereas the podia contain the latter only. Thus the podia use suction to attach to the substratum.	[]
UBERON:0008248	echinoderm pyloric cecum	The pyloric ceca (or digestive glands) and the cardiac stomach produce digestive enzymes in starfishes. Digested material is absorbed through the pyloric ceca for transport to the rest of the body. Each pyloric cecum extends the length of each arm.	["pyloric caecum","pyloric cecum"]
UBERON:0008250	cardiac stomach	In starfishes the cardiac stomach is connected to a pyloric stomach which is located above it. Food can be brought into the stomach through the mouth or, in many species, the cardiac stomach can be extended out through the mouth to digest food outside the body. Suspension-feeding starfish use their tube feet to pass food to the mouth.	[]
UBERON:0008251	water vascular system	The water vascular system is a hydraulic system used by echinoderms, such as sea stars and sea urchins, for locomotion, food and waste transportation, and respiration. The system is composed of canals connecting numerous tube feet. Echinoderms move by alternately contracting muscles that force water into the tube feet, causing them to extend and push against the ground, then relaxing to allow the feet to retract.	[]

UBERON:0008260	spine appendage	A hard, thorny or needle-like structure which occurs on various animals. Animals such as porcupines and sea urchins grow spines as a self-defense mechanism. Spines are often formed of keratin. Other animals with spines are hedgehogs, spiny mice and at least two ornithischian dinosaurs.	["spine"]
UBERON:0008261	pedicellaria	A small wrench or claw-shaped structure commonly found on Echinoderms, particularly in sea stars (class Asteroidea) and sea urchins (class Echinoidea). Pedicellariae are poorly understood but in some taxa, they are thought to keep the body surface clear of algae, encrusting organisms, and other debris in conjunction with the ciliated epidermis present in all echinoderms. Pedicellariae in some taxa, such as the deep-sea Brisingida, and the Antarctic Labidiaster are known to function in food capture. In forcipulate sea stars, each pedicellaria is typically composed three forceps-like valves. Other asteroids can have pedicellariae composed of only two components. In some asteroid sea stars pedicellariae are present around the base of a spine or on the surface of the animal's body. In other sea stars, they are present in pits on the abactinal, marginal, or actinal surface; oftentimes on the adambulacral plate adjacent to the tube foot furrow.	["pedicellariae"]

UBERON:0008269	nacre	An organic-inorganic composite material produced by some mollusks as an inner shell layer; it is also what makes up pearls. It is very strong, resilient, and iridescent. Nacre is found in some ancient lineages of bivalve gastropod and cephalopod. The inner layer in the great majority of mollusk shells is porcellaneous, not nacreous, frequently resulting in a non-iridescent shine or less commonly in non-nacreous iridescence such as flame structure (e.g. conch pearl). Pearls and the inside layer of pearl oyster and freshwater pearl mussel shells are made of nacre. Many other families of mollusk also have a nacreous inner shell layer, including marine gastropods such as the Haliotidae, the Trochidae and the Turbinidae. Nacre is composed of hexagonal platelets of aragonite (a form of calcium carbonate) 10-20 µm wide and 0.5 µm thick arranged in a continuous parallel lamina. These layers are separated by sheets of organic matrix composed of elastic biopolymers (such as chitin, lustrin and silk-like proteins).	["mother of pearl"]
UBERON:0008270	mollusc shell	A calcareous exoskeleton which encloses, supports and protects the soft parts of an animal in the phylum Mollusca, which includes snails, clams, tusk shells, and several other classes. Not all shelled molluscs live in the sea, many live on the land and in freshwater.	[]

UBERON:0008296	obsolete femoral muscle		[]
UBERON:0008297	pennaceous feather	Pennaceous feathers are also known as contour feathers. This type of feather is present in most modern birds, and has been shown in some species of maniraptoran dinosaurs. Pennaceous feathers have a central shaft (or rachis) with vanes spreading to either side. These vanes are composed of a high number of flattened barbs, that are connected to one another with barbules. The barbules are tiny strands that criss-cross on the flattened side s of the barbs. This forms a kind of miniature velcro-like mesh that holds all the barbs together, stabilizing the vanes. Flight feathers (remiges and rectrices) are specialized types of pennaceous feathers, adapted for high loadings and often strongly asymmetric for improved flight performance.	[]

UBERON:0009673	accessory XI nerve cranial component		[]
UBERON:0009674	accessory XI nerve spinal component	The spinal root of accessory nerve (or part) is firm in texture, and its fibers arise from the motor cells in the lateral part of the anterior column of the gray substance of the medulla spinalis as low as the fifth cervical nerve. Passing through the lateral funiculus of the medulla spinalis, they emerge on its surface and unite to form a single trunk, which ascends between the ligamentum denticulatum and the posterior roots of the spinal nerves; enters the skull through the foramen magnum, and is then directed to the jugular foramen, through which it passes, lying in the same sheath of dura mater as the vagus, but separated from it by a fold of the arachnoid. In the jugular foramen, it receives one or two filaments from the cranial part of the nerve, or else joins it for a short distance and then separates from it again. As its exit from the jugular foramen, it runs backward in front of the internal jugular vein in 66.6 per cent. of cases, and behind in it 33.3 per cent. The nerve then descends obliquely behind the Digastricus and Stylohyoideus to the upper part of the Sternocleidomastoideus; it pierces this muscle, and courses obliquely across the posterior triangle of the neck, to end in the deep surface of the Trapezius. As it traverses the Sternocleidomastoideus it gives several filaments to the muscle, and joins with branches from the second cervical nerve. In the posterior triangle it unites with the second and third cervical nerves, while beneath the Trapezius it forms a plexus with the third and fourth cervical nerves, and from this plexus fibers are distributed to the muscle.

UBERON:0009675	chorda tympani branch of facial nerve	The chorda tympani is a nerve that branches from the facial nerve (cranial nerve VII) inside the facial canal, just before the facial nerve exits the skull via the stylomastoid foramen. Chorda tympani is a branch of the facial nerve (the seventh cranial nerve) that serves the taste buds in the front of the tongue, runs through the middle ear, and carries taste messages to the brain. The chorda tympani is part of one of three cranial nerves that are involved in taste. The taste system involves a complicated feedback loop, with each nerve acting to inhibit the signals of other nerves. The chorda tympani appears to exert a particularly strong inhibitory influence on other taste nerves, as well as on pain fibers in the tongue. When the chorda tympani is damaged, its inhibitory function is disrupted, leading to less inhibited activity in the other nerves.

A deposit of calcareous material now takes place in this matrix, between the rows of cells, so that they become separated from each other by longitudinal columns of calcified matrix, presenting a granular and opaque appearance. Here and there the matrix between two cells of the same row also becomes calcified, and transverse bars of calcified substance stretch across from one calcareous column to another.

UBERON:0011110	humeroulnar joint	The humeroulnar joint, is part of the elbow-joint or the Olecron Joint, between the ulna and humerus bones is the simple hinge-joint, which allows for movements of flexion, extension and circumduction. The Humero-Ulnar Joint is the junction of trochlear notch of the ulna and the trochlea of the humerus. Owing to the obliquity of the trochlea of the humerus, this movement does not take place in the antero-posterior plane of the body of the humerus. When the forearm is extended and supinated, the axis of the arm and forearm are not in the same line; the arm forms an obtuse angle with the forearm. During flexion, however, the forearm and the hand tend to approach the middle line of the body, and thus enable the hand to be easily carried to the face. The accurate adaptation of the trochlea of the humerus, with its prominences and depressions, to the semilunar notch of the ulna, prevents any lateral movement. Flexion is produced by the action of the Biceps brachii and Brachialis, assisted by the Brachioradialis, with a tiny contribution from the muscles arising from the medial epicondyle of the humerus. Extension is produced by the Triceps brachii and AnconC&us, with a tiny contribution from the muscles arising from the lateral epicondyle of the humerus, such as the Extensor digitorum communis.

It lies beneath the cleidocervicalis. Its origin is the clavicular tendon with its insertion being at the mastoid process of the temporal bone. It is distinctly narrow and is united with the cleidocervicalis and cleidobrachialis by the clavicular tendon. Together with the other two components of the brachiocephalicus muscle, its primary function is to advance the free limb, however, it can also act as an shoulder extensor. Acting bilaterally, it fixes and depresses the neck, while by its unilateral action, it allows the head and neck to be drawn to the side. Its blood supply is the inferior cervical, carotid and vertebral arteries and its nerve supply is the spinal accessory, cervical and axillary nerves.	["cleidocephalic","cleidocephalic muscle","cleidocephalicus"]
UBERON:0011366	cleidobrachialis muscle	This muscle makes up the distal segment of the brachiocephalicus. It originates at the clavicular tendon but functionally, from the head and neck through the cleidocervicalis. It inserts at the distal end of the cranial border of the humerus, where it lies between the biceps brachii medially and the brachialis laterally. The muscle partly covers the pectoral muscles at their insertions. In conjunction with the cleidocervicalis, it advances the limb, extends the shoulder and causes lateral movement of the head and neck.	["cleidobrachial","cleidobrachial muscle","cleidobrachialis"]
UBERON:0011368	brachiocephalic muscle	The brachiocephalicus is a long and flat, complex of muscles that extends from the lower half of the humeral shaft to the head and neck. The muscle divides into two parts at the clavicular intersection. This is also the point of origin for all the muscles that make up the brachiocephalicus. This point is situated just cranial to the shoulder. The two main sections are the cleidobrachialis which is distal to the clavicular intersection and the cleidocephalicus which extends proximally to the clavivular intersection. The cleidocephalicus can also be divided into the pars cervicalis, which inserts on the broad aponeurosis, over the fibrous raphe of the cranial half of the neck. The other part, the pars mastoideus inserts on the mastoid process of the temporal bone via a strong tendon. The cleidobrachialis extends distally from the clavicular intersection and inserts on the cranial edge of the distal half of the humerus. The tendon that inserts the cleidobrachialis lies between the brachialis muscle and the biceps brachii. As a result of the brachiocephalicus spanning a large region it has the ability to provide a number of actions. These include extending the shoulder joint, protracts the limb, provides lateral movement of the head and allows the neck to be depressed.	["brachiocephalicus"]
UBERON:0011369	omotransversarius muscle	The omotransversarius is a straplike muscle, which advances and adducts the forelimb, as well as flexes the neck laterally. It covers the transverse processes of the cervical vertebrae, lying to their side. The omotransversarius lies ventral to the trapezius, cranial to the deltoid muscle and is covered cranially by the cleidocervicalis. It extends from the atlas to the spine of the scapula, with its origin on the transverse process of the atlas and its insertion in the distal end of the spine of the scapula. Its name can be split into omo, which is Greek for shoulder, and tranversarius which relates to its attachment to the transverse process of the atlas. This muscle is innervated by the accessory nerve.	["omotransverse","omotransverse muscle"]

The movement which takes place in this joint is more extensive than that in the other tarsal joints, and consists of a sort of rotation by means of which the foot may be slightly flexed or extended, the sole being at the same time carried medially (inverted) or laterally.	["articulatio tarsi transversa","chopart's joint","midtarsal joint"]
UBERON:0011963	talocalcaneonavicular joint	The talocalcaneonavicular articulation is an arthrodial joint: the rounded head of the talus being received into the concavity formed by the posterior surface of the navicular, the anterior articular surface of the calcaneus, and the upper surface of the plantar calcaneonavicular ligament. There are two ligaments in this joint: the articular capsule and the dorsal talonavicular.	["articulatio talocalcaneonavicularis","talocalcaneonavicular articulation"]
UBERON:0011964	calcaneocuboid joint	Calcaneocuboid Articulation (articulation of the calcaneus with the cuboid).

UBERON:0011967	costotransverse joint	The facet of the tubercle of the rib forms an articulation with the adjacent transverse process of a thoracic vertebra. This is a plane type synovial joint called the costotransverse joint. This articulation is present in all but the eleventh and twelfth ribs. Ribs 1 to 10 have two joints in close proximity posteriorly; the costovertebral joints and the costotranseverse joints. This arrangement restrains the motion of the ribs allowing them to work in a parallel fashion during breathing. If a typical rib had only one joint posteriorly the resultant swivel action would allow a rib to be non-parallel with respect to the neighboring ribs making for a very inefficient respiratory mechanism. The ventral rami innervate the costotransverse joints. Therefore, therapeutic medial branch blocks are ineffectual. The ligaments of the joint are: Articular capsule Posterior costotransverse Anterior costotransverse Ligament of the neck of the rib Ligament of the tubercle of the rib	[]

UBERON:0012255	inferior phrenic artery	The inferior phrenic arteries are two small vessels, which supply the diaphragm but present much variety in their origin. They may arise separately from the front of the aorta, immediately above the celiac artery, or by a common trunk, which may spring either from the aorta or from the celiac artery. Sometimes one is derived from the aorta, and the other from one of the renal arteries; they rarely arise as separate vessels from the aorta. They diverge from one another across the crura of the diaphragm, and then run obliquely upward and lateralward upon its under surface. The left phrenic passes behind the esophagus, and runs forward on the left side of the esophageal hiatus. The right phrenic passes behind the inferior vena cava, and along the right side of the foramen which transmits that vein. Near the back part of the central tendon each vessel divides into a medial and a lateral branch. The medial branch curves forward, and anastomoses with its fellow of the opposite side, and with the musculophrenic and pericardiacophrenic arteries. The lateral branch passes toward the side of the thorax, and anastomoses with the lower intercostal arteries, and with the musculophrenic. The lateral branch of the right phrenic gives off a few vessels to the inferior vena cava; and the left one, some branches to the esophagus.

Only giraffids have true ossicones (as opposed to horns or antlers). The base that a deer's antlers grow from is very similar to ossicones. Ossicones are similar to the horns of antelopes and cattle, save that they are derived from ossified cartilage, and that the ossicones remain covered in skin and fur, rather than horn. Antlers (such as on deer) are derived from bone tissue: when mature, the skin and fur covering of the antlers, termed 'velvet,' is sloughed and scraped off to expose the bone of the antlers.	[]

UBERON:0013217	zygomatic plate	In rodent anatomy, the zygomatic plate is a bony plate derived from the flattened front part of the zygomatic arch (cheekbone). At the back, it connects to the front (maxillary) root of the zygomatic arch, and at the top it is connected to the rest of the skull via the antorbital bridge. It is part of the maxillary bone, or upper jaw, which also contains the upper cheekteeth. Primitively, rodents have a nearly horizontal zygomatic plate. In association with specializations in zygomasseteric system, several distinct morphologies have developed across the order. The term is also used for an analogous structure in some South American typotheres, including Pseudotypotherium and Medistylus.	[]
UBERON:0013218	rete mirabile	A rete mirabile (Latin for 'wonderful net'; plural retia mirabilia) is a complex of arteries and veins lying very close to each other, found in some vertebrates. The rete mirabile utilizes countercurrent blood flow within the net (blood flowing in opposite directions. ) It exchanges heat, ions, or gases between vessel walls so that the two bloodstreams within the rete maintain a gradient with respect to temperature, or concentration of gases or solutes.	[]
UBERON:0013219	parotoid gland	The parotoid gland (alternatively, paratoid gland) is an external skin gland on the back, neck, and shoulder of toads and some frogs and salamanders. It secretes a milky alkaloid substance to deter predators. The substance produced acts as a neurotoxin. Parotoid glands are sometimes said to be wart-like in appearance, though warts are abnormal growths caused by viral infections while parotoid glands are normal, healthy parts of the animals that bear them. The vague similarity in appearance, however, is the reason behind the mistaken belief that touching a toad causes warts.	[]

UBERON:0013223	alveolar gland	In contrast to tubular glands, in the second main variety of gland, the secretory portion is enlarged and the lumen variously increased in size. These are termed alveolar glands (or saccular glands, or acinar glands, or acinous glands). Some sources draw a clear distinction between acinar and alveolar glands, based upon the shape of the lumen. A further complication in the case of the alveolar glands may occur in the form of still smaller saccular diverticuli growing out from the main sacculi. These are termed alveoli. The term 'tubulo-alveolar' (or 'tubulo-acinar', or 'compound tubulo-acinar', or 'compound tubulo-alveolar') is used to describe glands that start out as branched tubular, and branch further to terminate in alveoli. This type of gland is found in the salivary glands, esophagus, and mammary glands. The term 'racemose gland' is used to describe a 'compound alveolar gland' or 'compound acinar gland'.	[]
UBERON:0013224	Ciaccio's gland	Ciaccio's glands are small tubular accessory lacrimal glands (glandulae lacrimales accessoriae) found in the lacrimal caruncle of the eyelid. They are located in the upper border of the tarsus, approximately in the middle between the extremities of the tarsal glands. Sometimes they are situated slightly above the tarsus. There are usually 2 to 5 of these glands in the upper eyelid, and their function is to produce tears which are secreted onto the surface of the conjunctiva. They are named after Italian anatomist Giuseppe Vincenzo Ciaccio (1824b1901), who described these glands in 1874. They are sometimes called Wolfring's glands after Polish ophthalmologist Emilj von Wolfring (1832-1906), who described them during the same time period as did Ciaccio. Another type of accessory lacrimal gland are Krause's glands, which are smaller, more numerous than Ciaccio's glands and are found along the superior and inferior fornices of the conjunctival sac.

UBERON:0013228	sweat gland of eyelid	Glands of Moll, also known as ciliary glands, are modified apocrine sweat glands that are found on the margin of the eyelid. They are next to the base of the eyelashes, and anterior to the Meibomian glands within the distal eyelid margin. These glands are relatively large and tubular-shaped. The glands of Moll are named after Dutch oculist Jacob Anton Moll (1832-1914). Glands of Moll empty into the adjacent lashes. Glands of Moll and Zeis secrete lipid that adds to the superficial layer of the tear film, retarding evaporation. The glands of Moll are prone to infection and blockage of its duct with sebum and cell debris. Blockage of the gland's duct causes swelling which can manifest itself as a stye.

UBERON:0013529	Brodmann area	A segmentation of the cerebral cortex on the basis of cytoarchitecture as described in Brodmann-1905, Brodmann-1909 and Brodmann-10. Maps for several species were presented. NeuroNames includes only areas in the human and in Old World monkeys. Of the latter, Brodmann studied representatives of several species including guenons (one Cercopithecus mona, one Cercocebus torquatus, and one Cercopithecus otherwise unspecified), which are all closely related African species, and one macaque (Macaca mulatta) an Asian species (Brodmann-1905). The legend to the summary map in Brodmann-1909 ascribes the areas simply to Cercopithecus. Brodmann referenced the areas by name and number. The same area number in humans and monkeys did not necessarily refer to topologically or cytoarchitecturally homologous structures. In NeuroNames the standard term for human areas consists of the English translation of Brodmann's Latin name followed by the number he assigned, e.g., agranular frontal area 6; the standard terms for monkey areas are in the format: area 6 of Brodmann-1909. He mapped a portion of areas limited to the banks of sulci, e.g., area 3 of Brodmann-1909 (Brodmann-1909) onto the adjacent, visible surface. This accounts for the fact that some areas appear larger on his surface map than on maps of other authors, e.g., area 3 of Vogts-1919. (Adapted from NeuroNames)	[]

This area is believed to play a part in strategic processes involved in memory retrieval and executive function. This area is also called frontopolar area 10, and it refers to a subdivision of the cytoarchitecturally defined frontal region of cerebral cortex. It occupies the most rostral portions of the superior frontal gyrus and the middle frontal gyrus. In humans, on the medial aspect of the hemisphere it is bounded ventrally by the superior rostral sulcus (H). It does not extend as far as the cingulate sulcus. Cytoarchitecturally it is bounded dorsally by the granular frontal area 9, caudally by the middle frontal area 46, and ventrally by the orbital area 47 and by the rostral area 12 or, in an early version of Brodmann's cortical map (Brodmann-1909), the prefrontal Brodmann area 11-1909.

It is a relatively undifferentiated cortical area that Brodmann regarded as part of the insula because of the relation of its innermost multiform layer (VI) with the claustrum (VICl). The laminar organization of cortex is almost totally lacking. The molecular layer (I) is wide as in area 15 of Brodmann-1905. The space between layer I and layer VI is composed of a mixture of pyramidal cells and spindle cells with no significant number of granule cells. Pyramidal cells clump in the outer part to form glomeruli similar to those seen in some of the primary olfactory areas (Brodmann-1905). This term also refers to an area known as peripaleocortical claustral - a cytoarchitecturally defined (agranular) portion of the insula at its rostral extreme where it approaches most closely the claustrum and the prepyriform area (Stephan-76).

UBERON:0014440	ischiopubic ramus	The ischiopubic ramus is a compound structure consisting of the following two structures: from the pubis, the inferior pubic ramus from the ischium, the inferior ramus of the ischium It serves as part of the origin for the Obturator internus muscle. It also marks a vertex of the anal triangle and the urogenital triangle. The fascia of Colles is attached to its margin.	["conjoint ramus"]
UBERON:0014441	ischial ramus		["ramus of ischium","ramus ossis ischii","ramusi ossis ischii"]
UBERON:0014442	superior ischial ramus	The superior ramus of the ischium (descending ramus) projects downward and backward from the body and presents for examination three surfaces: external, internal, and posterior. The external surface is quadrilateral in shape. It is bounded above by a groove which lodges the tendon of the Obturator externus; below, it is continuous with the inferior ramus; in front it is limited by the posterior margin of the obturator foramen; behind, a prominent margin separates it from the posterior surface. In front of this margin the surface gives origin to the Quadratus femoris, and anterior to this to some of the fibers of origin of the Obturator externus; the lower part of the surface gives origin to part of the Adductor magnus. The internal surface forms part of the bony wall of the lesser pelvis. In front it is limited by the posterior margin of the obturator foramen. Below, it is bounded by a sharp ridge which gives attachment to a falciform prolongation of the sacrotuberous ligament, and, more anteriorly, gives origin to the Transversus perinC&i and Ischiocavernosus. Posteriorly the ramus forms a large swelling, the tuberosity of the ischium	[]
UBERON:0014443	inferior ischial ramus	The Inferior Ramus of the ischium (ascending ramus) is the thin, flattened part of the ischium, which ascends from the superior ramus, and joins the inferior ramus of the pubisbthe junction being indicated in the adult by a raised line. The outer surface is uneven for the origin of the obturator externus and some of the fibers of the adductor magnus; its inner surface forms part of the anterior wall of the pelvis. Its medial border is thick, rough, slightly everted, forms part of the outlet of the pelvis, and presents two ridges and an intervening space. The ridges are continuous with similar ones on the inferior ramus of the pubis: to the outer is attached the deep layer of the superficial perineal fascia (fascia of Colles), and to the inner the inferior fascia of the urogenital diaphragm. If these two ridges be traced downward, they will be found to join with each other just behind the point of origin of the transversus perinC&i; here the two layers of fascia are continuous behind the posterior border of the muscle. To the intervening space, just in front of the point of junction of the ridges, the transversus perinC&i is attached, and in front of this a portion of the crus penis vel clitoridis and the ischiocavernosus. Its lateral border is thin and sharp, and forms part of the medial margin of the obturator foramen.	[]

UBERON:0015216	nasal meatus		[]
UBERON:0015219	middle nasal meatus	The middle meatus is a nasal opening or canal situated between the middle and inferior conchae, and extends from the anterior to the posterior end of the latter. The lateral wall of this meatus can be satisfactorily studied only after the removal of the middle concha. On it is a curved fissure, the hiatus semilunaris, limited below by the edge of the uncinate process of the ethmoid and above by an elevation named the bulla ethmoidalis; the middle ethmoidal cells are contained within this bulla and open on or near to it. Through the hiatus semilunaris the meatus communicates with a curved passage termed the infundibulum, which communicates in front with the anterior ethmoidal cells and in rather more than fifty percent of skulls is continued upward as the frontonasal duct into the frontal air-sinus; when this continuity fails, the frontonasal duct opens directly into the anterior part of the meatus. Below the bulla ethmoidalis and hidden by the uncinate process of the ethmoid is the opening of the maxillary sinus (ostium maxillare); an accessory opening is frequently present above the posterior part of the inferior nasal concha.	[]
UBERON:0015220	inferior nasal meatus	The inferior meatus, the largest of the three meatuses of the nose, is the space between the inferior concha and the floor of the nasal cavity.

UBERON:0015221	common nasal meatus		[]
UBERON:0015222	ventral nasal meatus	The ventral nasal meatus is found between the ventral nasal concha and the dorsal surface of the hard palate.It connects the nasal vestibule with the nasopharynx. Rostrally it is narrow at the nasal vestibule and widens caudally towards the nasopharyngeal meatus. The ventral nasal meatus is the main passage for air. Apart from olfaction, the nasal cavity functions to warm the inhaled air as it passes through the meatuses over the vascular beds of the mucosa. The air is humidified by the vaporization of tears and serous nasal secretion. The air is cleaned throughout the scattered mucous glands. These glands secrete mucous through the nasal cavity and the mucous serves to trap the large particles that come into contact with it. PPP Clinically in the horse the ventral nasal meatus is the main passage through which a stomach tube can be passed to the pharynx and oesophagus and then to the stomach. This kind of a tube is commonly used when drenching a horse for colic, as well as having many other veterinary applications. The tube has to pass through the ventral nasal meatus to the nasopharyngeal meatus and the caudal nares to reach the pharynx and oesophagus. If the tube is accidentally passed into the dorsal or middle nasal meatuses it would pass to the ethmotubinates and cause massive haemorrhage.	[]
UBERON:0015223	dorsal nasal meatus	The dosal nasal meatus is a narrow passage bounded dorsally by the roof of the nasal cavity and ventrally by the dorsal concha. It terminates caudally at the junction of the inner plate of the frontal bone with the cribiform plate and lateral mass of the ethmoid bone. It is the shortest and shallowest of the three meatuses.

UBERON:0017626	transverse folds of rectum	Houston's valves (or transverse folds of rectum) are semi-lunar transverse folds of the rectal wall that protrude into the anal canal. Their use seems to be to support the weight of fecal matter, and prevent its urging toward the anus, which would produce a strong urge to defecate. Although the term rectum means straight, these transverse folds overlap each other during the empty state of the intestine to such an extent that, as Houston remarked, they require considerable maneuvering to conduct an instrument along the canal, as often occurs in sigmoidoscopy and colonoscopy. These folds are about 12 mm. in width and are composed of the circular muscle coat of the rectum. They are usually three in number; sometimes a fourth is found, and occasionally only two are present. One is situated near the commencement of the rectum, on the right side. A second extends inward from the left side of the tube, opposite the middle of the sacrum. A third, the largest and most constant, projects backward from the forepart of the rectum, opposite the fundus of the urinary bladder. When a fourth is present, it is situated nearly 2.5 cm above the anus on the left and posterior wall of the tube.

UBERON:0022268	planum temporale	The planum temporale is the cortical area just posterior to the auditory cortex within the Sylvian fissure. It is a triangular region which forms the heart of Wernicke's area, one of the most important functional areas for language. The planum temporale shows a significant asymmetry. In 65% of all individuals the left planum temporale appears to be more developed, while the right planum temporale is more developed in only 10%. In some peoplebs brains, the planum temporale is more than five times larger on the left than on the right, making it the most asymmetrical structure in the brain. This greater size of the left planum temporale compared with the right is already present in the foetus, where it can be observed starting from the 31st week of gestation. This observation strengthens the hypothesis of a genetic predisposition for brain asymmetry.	[]

As defined here, tegmentum refers to the whole of the midbrain (Baer, 1837) excluding the tectum but including the pretectal region (Scalia, 1972); see Swanson (2000, pp. 522, 526).

UBERON:6001668	insect embryonic/larval lymph gland	Hematopoietic organ of the larva, located along the dorsal vessel, behind the brain. It produces the plasmatocytes, crystal cells and lamellocytes which are released at the end of the larval instar and onset of metamorphosis. It is composed of 3 pairs of bilateral lobes: an anterior primary lobe, a posterior secondary lobe and the most posterior lobe (or multiple lobes), the tertiary lobe. Each lobe is separated by pericardial cells. In the late embryo, the lymph gland consists of a single pair of lobes (primary lobes) containing around 20 cells each that flank the dorsal vessel. By the second larval instar, the lymph gland is composed of two or three new pairs of posterior lobes, and the primary lobes have increased in size to contain around 200 cells. During the first and early second larval instars, the lymph gland comprises only the hematopoietic progenitor population. The lymph gland increases in size ten-fold by the late third instar, and at this stage the progenitor cells (prohemocytes) become restricted to the medial region (medullary zone) of the primary lobe and become quiescent. The differentiated hemocytes are found in the periphery (cortical zone) of the primary lobe and these cells proliferate extensively. The posterior signalling center is a group of about 30 cells at the posterior tip of the primary lobe that secretes several signalling molecules and functions as a stem-cell niche. The secondary and tertiary lobes contain prohemocytes, and rarely a differentiated cell. Lymph glands are eliminated at metamorphosis.	["embryonic/larval hematopoietic organ","hematopoietic organ"]
